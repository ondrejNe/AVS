\chapter{Summary}\label{ch:conclusion}
This document lays out the foundational principles, its architecture, and the communication model with
its relations to the underlying hardware.

In a limited scope, the project aims to create a distributed embedded data acquisition system that would simulate
functionalities comparable to those found in an experimental rocket.
Apart from the real application, which would be much more complex and extensive, the proposed instalment is designed to
be a small standalone unit that would serve as an exemplary model.

Given emphasis on exploring the capabilities of a distributed processing paradigm, the system is built around three
MCUs connected via the single CAN bus representing the joint communication medium.
On top of that, the system is designed to acquire telemetry data from various sources
and lastly visualize it in a user-friendly manner to provide comprehensive real-time analysis.
